# Permissions

For what does **Pyron** need:

``Administrator`` __Pyron uses the **Administrator** permission as a fallback in case specific permissions are missing for future commands or events. This can be toggled off either when adding the bot or afterward by editing the bot's role permissions.__

``Manage Server`` __Pyron uses the **Manage Server** permission to access the guildâ€™s invites and begin tracking them.__

``Manage Roles`` __Pyron uses the **Manage Roles** permission to assign roles to users who have reached a certain number of invites. The number of invites required is determined by the administrators.__

 ``Kick,Ban Members`` __Pyron uses the **Kick/Ban Members** permission to kick users when the command is run by someone with administrator permissions.__

``Manage Messages`` __Pyron uses the **Manage Messages** permission for a purge command, which will be available soon.__
