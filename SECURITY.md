# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this Discord bot, please message [me](https://discord.com/users/1025125432825237514) or open an issue in the GitHub repository. All reports will be reviewed and addressed as quickly as possible.

## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your Discord bot, consider the following best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly check for updates to dependencies and ensure they are up to date. This helps mitigate vulnerabilities present in older versions.

2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information such as bot tokens and API keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your codebase.

3. **Limit Permissions**: When creating your Discord bot, grant it only the permissions it needs to function. Avoid giving excessive permissions that could be exploited.

4. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly monitor your bot's logs for any suspicious activity. This can help identify potential security threats early.

5. **Validate User Input**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks and other malicious actions.

6. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: For added security, enable 2FA on your Discord account and any associated services.
